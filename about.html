                making new friends. <br>
                As a club we've read fiction books every month since October 2019. We aim to help people to read more
                and
                connect with all kinds of curious and interesting people. We cover a new theme each
                month with three short-listed books for members to vote on.

                            Hey guys! My name is Elise, I am a professor at Trinity College. I am originally from
                            Galway. I have 2 kids who are now 10 and 13. Since I was their age,I was fascinated
                            about books and could not get enough of them. I met Maria and together, we decided to
                            start this amazing project, which is the Lighthouse book club. Looking forward to
                            meeting all of you!</p>

                            Hello everybody! This is Maria. I am originally from Germany, moved to Dublin over 10
                            years ago. I am a journalist and also teach at UCD. Like Elise, I am passionate about
                            reading. During lunch on a rainy Saturday, we came up with an idea of creating our own
                            book club. I am so happy to see how much we achieved so far.</p>

                    books
                    based on a topic or an agreed-upon reading list.</p>
