        <p>The Lighthouse book club was create to inspirng meaningful discussions while socializing and
            making new friends.
            As a club we've read a non-fiction book every month since November 2019. We aim to help people to read more
            and
            connect with all kinds of curious and interesting people. We cover a new theme each
            month with three short-listed books for members to vote on. Members of the community recieve a bi-weekly
            newsletter with all the updates and news related to the club. Because of the pandemic many of our first
            meetup
            were online via Zoom, but with things getting better in-person meet up started to happen and so far it has
            been
            amazing. We are always open to suggestions and feedback.
