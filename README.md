## Testing

All tests described below have worked successfully across all browsers. Responsiveness checks have been run by using the Chrome developers's tools as well as manually resizing the windows.
This site was tested across multiple browsers (Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer) and on multiple mobile devices (iPhone 4, 5, 7: Chrome and Safari, iPad, Samsung Galaxy) to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.

It was tested:
* Form submission - If the user tries to submit the join us form with an invalid email address, there will be an error noting the invalid email address. The 'required' attribute is added to the 'First name',’Last Name' and ‘Email Address'. The users must also agree with the terms listed to be able to submit the form. 

* All the links to social media accounts will open a new page, so the users do not leave the site.The same will happen in the Books page. If the user clicks on the cover of the book, a new page will be opened bringing them to Good Reads and also if they press the ‘Shop now’ button, the Eason’s page will be loaded in a separate tab. The meet up section, on the main page, also contains embedded links to google maps, which are working fine.

* When the screen is 768px and down, the navigation bar will collapse. When the user clicks on it a dropdown menu will open,from which the user can easily navigate to any other page of the site or go back to the home page by clicking on the logo.

* The images on the ‘Meet up’ section are responsive and they will change size whenever needed to fit better the screen size. 

* To tell the user which page they are at, the menu item belonging to that page will be in red, making it simpler and easier for them to notice.
